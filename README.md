EMQX provides a built-in management console, the EMQX Dashboard. It allows users to easily manage and monitor EMQX clusters and configure and use the required features from a web page.

## Main features

- Data monitoring and management: important data clear at a glance
- Visually manage access control: out-of-the-box authentication and authorization management
- Powerful data integration capabilities: Flow editor and bi-directional data bridge
- Online configuration update: hot updates that save your configuration immediately
- Customizable extension capabilities: built-in gateways, plugins and Hooks
- More comprehensive diagnostic tools: identify and resolve problems in time

## Running

Install the latest version of [EMQX](https://www.emqx.com/en/try?product=broker) first.

After installing EMQX successfully, you can access and use EMQX Dashboard by opening <http://localhost:18083/> (replace localhost with the actual IP address if deployed on a non-local machine) through your browser. EMQX Dashboard is a web application that listens to port 18083 by default.

> EMQX can still be used normally without Dashboard enabled, Dashboard just provides the option for users to use it visually.

## Develop

```shell
# Project setup
yarn

# Compiles and hot-reloads for development localhost
yarn serve

# Compiles and minifies for production
yarn build

# Lints and fixes files
yarn lint
```

### Development with Cloud Host

To compile and hot-reload for development with a cloud host, follow these steps:

1. Create a .env.cloud file in the root directory with the following content:

    ```shell
    HOST_URL=http://your-cloud-host:port/
    ```

2. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    yarn serve:cloud
    ```

## Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

The CI will then run automatically, and it will be released after the run is complete.
